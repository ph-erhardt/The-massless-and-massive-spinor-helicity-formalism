This repo contains the code of my Bachelor's thesis on the massless and massive spinor-helicity formalism. There it is used to perform the evaluation of the tree-level helicity amplitudes for massive MÃ¶ller scattering. 
- The file "spinor_helicity.py" contains the python module written for spinor-helicity calculations.
- The file "evaluation_code_massive_Moller_scattering.ipynb" contains the actual evalution of the helicity amplitudes.
