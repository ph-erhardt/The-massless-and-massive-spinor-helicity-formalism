This repo contains additional files for my Bachelor's thesis on the massless and massive spinor-helicity formalism. In detail:
- The file "Erhardt - Calculation of tree-level helicity amplitudes using the massless spinor-helicity formalism - 2025.pdf" contains my reasearch oriented project cited in the thesis.
- The file "spinor_helicity.py" contains the python module written for spinor-helicity calculations.
- The file "evaluation_code_massive_Moller_scattering.ipynb" contains the evalution code of the tree-level helicity amplitudes for massive MÃ¶ller scattering using spinor_helicity.py
